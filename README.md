PlayerCountAPI
==============

Bukkit Plugin

adds some extra features to bukkit servers,

1. keeps track of total number of logins per session.
2. displays total logged in when a player joins/leaves
3. allows the server to enter a state where it will not allow new players, and will shutdown when empty
